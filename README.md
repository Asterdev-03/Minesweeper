# Minesweeper Game

This program aims at creating a game called Minesweeper.

## About

Minesweeper is a deceptively simple test of memory and reasoning and one of the most popular Windows games of all time.
It is not as accurate as the original but it mimics all the fundamental concepts of the original Minesweeper.

## Objective

The Objective of the game is to uncover all the rectangular boxes/fields that don't contain mines without detonating any of the mines.
The game provides clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each field. Use these clues to uncover the fields without opening a box containing a mine.
Once youâ€™ve opened eveything but the mines, you have won the game.
